OBTAINING AN API KEY:
=============================================

You can obtain an API key for the service from the following location: http://guardian.mashery.com/ 
(if you already have an account through another mashery service, you can login instead of registering a new account)
	
	
DETAILS:
=============================================

I wrote this tag-based CFC wrapper to access the Guardian Open Platform API (details and spec can be found here http://www.guardian.co.uk/open-platform)

Creating/initiating the CFC: (where __api__key__ is your API key to access the service)

	Example:
	
	<cfset openPlatform = 
				createObject(
					"component", 
					"com.coldfumonkeh.guardian.openAPI"
				)
				.init(
					apikey='__api__key__',
					parseOutput=false	
				) />


That's it. You are ready to go.
Easy!


EXAMPLES:
============================================


<cfset openResults = openAPI.search(q='environment') /> - all content mentioning "environment"


<!---
	All content mentioning "iPhone" published after and including 17th August 2010, returned in JSON format.
--->
<cfset openResults = openAPI.search(
						q='iPhone',
						format='json',
						fromdate='2010-08-17'
					) /> 

<!---
	All keywords containing "Katy Perry", returned in JSON format.
--->
<cfset openResults = openAPI.tags(
						q='Katy Perry',
						format='json'
					) />


<!---
	Returning specific content based upon the item ID, returned in XML format, showing related content.
--->
<cfset openResults = openAPI.item(
						itemID='music/series/whats-in-katy-perrys-hand', 
						format='xml', 
						showrelated=true, 
						showtags='all'
					) />


<!---
	Obtain a list of available sections within the API.
--->
<cfset openResults = openAPI.sections(format='json') />


OUTPUT:
=============================================

All methods currently return the data as either XML (default) or JSON.


NOTES
=============================================

The only location of hard coded data within any of the components is in the API.cfc within the init function.

<cfset variables.instance.rootURL = 'http://api.guardianapis.com/content/' />

This is the location/path used by the API to access the remote methods.
